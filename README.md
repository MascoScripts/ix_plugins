# adminstick_ix Config Instructions
This plugin is only compatible currently with SAM Admin Module from the Gmodstore. Make sure you edit the sh_plugin.lua file and edit the MascoStick.StaffGroups{} table with your correct usergroups setup in SAM. To give Staff Members the Admin Stick when they load their character automatically, edit the sv_plugin.lua file and make sure the FACTION_STAFF is the index of your staff faction.
