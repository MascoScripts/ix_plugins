This is a collection of plugins that I have made for the Helix game mode in Garry's Mod. You are free to use and edit these plugins as you see, but please don't attempt to claim them as your own.

# typewriter_ix In-Game Configuration
This addon comes with a couple of in-game configurations. The first one is the Anti-Spam Time. This is the amount of time (in seconds) that you'd like to make the player wait between uses of the Typewriter. This is designed to keep people from spamming documents over and over. The second is the max amount of copies a player can make of a document. This number also represents the max amount of documents that can be present in the inventory at once.

# adminstick_ix Config Instructions
This plugin is only compatible currently with SAM Admin Module from the Gmodstore. Make sure you edit the sh_plugin.lua file and edit the MascoStick.StaffGroups{} table with your correct usergroups setup in SAM. To give Staff Members the Admin Stick when they load their character automatically, edit the sv_plugin.lua file and make sure the FACTION_STAFF is the index of your staff faction.
